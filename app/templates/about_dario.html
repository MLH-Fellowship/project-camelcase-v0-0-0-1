        <p class="lead">
          Hello All, my name is Dario. I migrated to the United States right before 
          turning 12. I did not speak English when I first arrived in the US, but neither was I able to write or read in Spanish. 
        </p>
  
        <p class="lead">
          Upon arriving in the US. I requested to be placed in an all-English school 
          because I wanted to be able to communicate with other kids. After learning 
          some English, I had to also start learning to read and write in Spanish to
          be able to communicate with people at home. 
        </p>
  
        <p class="lead">
          I became curious about computers and programming and started doing independent studies into them. 
          I began with HTML, then moved to CSS, and finally JavaScript. 
          In my senior year of high school, my school introduced an AP-CS class, my first formal computer science class. 
        </p>
  
        <p class="lead">
          In college, I was introduced to formal computational theories and more programming languages such as C++, Python, and SQL, and mathematical ways to analyze algorithms.

              <p>While working as a US-Sailing Instructor at Hudson River Community Sailing, 
                I teach multiple sailing curriculums in various programs, 
                such as an adult program and a youth program. 
                HRCS has helped me become a leader by providing me with the opportunity to develop programs and giving me 
                opportunities to implement changes as I see fit. </p>

              <p>As an application developer at the NYC Department of Transportation, 
                I worked on a front-end react application. Our goal was to make it easier for users 
                to share and request data from multiple systems in the city. 
                I was also tasked with creating ER diagrams for our database and researching query optimization options. </p>

              <p class="h2">Reading & Listening to Books</p>
              <p> I enjoy reading in my downtime. Usually, I do either Audio Books or read a hard copy, but often I do a combination of both. I enjoy reading classical novels and texts that prompt me to reflect. The list of my most impactful books is as follows; 1. Fahrenheit 451, 2. Catch-22, 3. Bluest Eye, 4. The Old Man and the Sea, and 5. Between the World and Me.

                <br/>
                I recently read Atlas of The Heart by Bren√© Brown, which I am still digesting...there is a lot there, lolz.
